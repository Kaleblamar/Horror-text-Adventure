          You find yourself at the entrance to the castle, surrounded by
          towering walls of stone and wrought iron gates that creak ominously in

          The air is thick with the scent of must and decay, and cobwebs cling
          to the walls and ceiling. You hear a faint rustling sound coming from
          somewhere deep within the castle, and your heart begins to race. You
          realize that you are not alone. Do you want to explore the main hall
          or ascend the stairs to the upper level of the castle?
